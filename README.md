## Branch Managment Guidlines
- Each collaborator must commit to their own respective branch (labled by their username) or the bugs branch for any problematic code.
- Always pull new updates before you push your new updates to you respective branches.
- Make sure your tests pass before commits.
- Give your commits to your branch meaningful names including: What you did and who you are - Github actions will reflect the date and time so you do not need to worry about that.
