## Branch Managment Guidlines
- It is better to create your own branch to use for implementing big features.
- If you want\need to commit broken code then commit to a branch.
- Always pull new updates before you push your new updates.
- Give your commits meaningful names including: What you did and who you are - Github actions will reflect the date and time so you do not need to worry about that.
