## Branch Managment Guidlines
- Each collaborator must commit to their own respective branch (labled by their username) or the "Bugs-and-Problems" branch for any problematic code.
- Always pull new updates before you push your new updates to you respective branches.
- Make sure your tests pass before commits.
- Give your commits to your branch meaningful names including: What you did and who you are - Github actions will reflect the date and time so you do not need to worry about that.

## Repository Etiquette 
- Make sure your folder/file names are meaningful but also not too complex - they must refrence the features and functionality where relevant.
- Note the branch management guidlines.

## Branch Names 
- main
- Bugs-and-Problems
- Chloe

## The types of Branches
- "main" is the branch where the code is kept in a working state - this is where the release build of our app is stored.
- The named branches are for developing different features assigned to that particular user.
- The "Bugs-and-Problems" is for when you need to commit problematic code with non-working and buggy functionality.
  
## File Structure
- The "src" folder houses the frontend html and Js.
- The "api" folder houses the api calls.
- The "_tests_" folder houses the tests on functions.
